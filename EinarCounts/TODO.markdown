Tasks
=====

- Play the correct voice for the displayed number
	- EinarVoices get a Player interface in the constructor
	- A Player interface implementor is the only class with a Context (Activity) that really plays sounds)
	- EinarVoices just generates / computes the resource id for each sound
	- EinarVoices can stop implementing an interface, it doesn't need a Context in the constructor
	
- more?
